# Running code in the browser
This is a minimal file to show how to put some output on the browser.

Open the index.html file in your browser of choice, Chrome, IE, Firefox.

# What's going on
In index.html we make a paragraph element. We also load a script that affects that paragraph element. 

```
<p id="demo">Try putting some text in the paragraph tag like this and see what happens!</p>
```
