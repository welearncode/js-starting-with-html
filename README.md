# Running code in the browser
This is a minimal file to show how to put some output on the browser.

Open the index.html file in your browser of choice, Chrome, IE, Firefox.

This is based on material from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp

# What's going on
In index.html we make a paragraph element.

We also load a script that affects that paragraph element. 

```
<p id="demo">Try putting some text in the paragraph tag like this and see what happens!</p>
```

# Using Git
You can get this code on your computer using Git. 

If you have git installed on your computer, open a shell where you'd like to put the code

```
git clone git@github.com:welearncode/js-starting-with-html.git
```
